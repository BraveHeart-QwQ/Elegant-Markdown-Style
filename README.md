# Elegant-Markdown-Style

A self-use Markdown style (suitable for study notes, documents), used with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Markdown Preview Enhanced plug-in](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced).

The inspiration for the style comes mainly from the following websites:
- [Google Protocol Buffers Doc](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
- [MSDN Doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system?view=net-7.0)
- [LearnOpenGL CN](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/)

p.s. I'm not good at english writing.

p.s. I'm not a front-end related worker, I just made this style out of interest. Pull requests is welcome.



## Install

### Install Fonts
- Raleway
- Noto Sans Symbols2 (not required on macOS)
- Roboto Serif
- Kaiti SC
- Cascadia Code
- Bungee Shade
- Monaco

Some fonts may be pre-installed on your system, go to the Fonts folder (Windows) or Font Book.app (macOS) to check.

These fonts may be found on Github or [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Install Style
Please make sure you have installed VSCode and Markdown Preview Enhanced, how to install these things will not be explained here.

- Open VSCode
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
- Enter "Customize CSS" and select the first option, it would open a file called `style.less`
- Delete **everything** in the `style.less`
- Copy **everything** from [my custom style](src/Customize%20CSS.less), and paste into `style.less`
- Save file



## Feature

p.s. The pictures shown below are screenshots from my macbook

p.s. I downloaded README.md from [Neovim for VSCode](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim/blob/master/README.md) as presentation text (because this doc use a lot Markdown's features). You can directly compare Github style and my style (picture below).

### Custom Header

p.s. This style only uses up to 4th level header

### Custom Font

Normal:
![](.Image/2023-01-11-16-50-41.png)

Bold (red text):
![](.Image/2023-01-11-16-52-20.png)

#### Definition
Bold is usually enough for 'everything' that needs attention, but I've added a "special bold" to mark 'concepts' that appear first time in context, which is useful for documentation and notes.

usage:
```markdown
<def>Earth</def> is the third planet from the Sun and the only place in the universe known to harbor life.
```

effect:
![](.Image/2023-01-11-15-46-49.png)

### Custom Table
The table of this style is inspired by MSDN. This table has a fixed maximum width and can cover the entire page horizontally, and the width of the first column always be 33% of current page.

effect:
![](.Image/2023-01-11-15-49-29.png)

### Image Style
The image is centered and the size can be controlled (I insert the picture by HTML code)

usage:
```markdown
<div align=center class=img><img src="PathToImage" style="zoom:100%"></br></div>
```

>- If you think it's troublesome to enter these string, you can use the VSCode's Snippets to make template. But I recommend using [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image&ssr=false#overview) plugin to paste pictures directly

#### Image Name

Add a name under the picture.

usage:
```markdown
<div align=center class=img><img src="./.Image/flower.jpeg" style="zoom:100%"></br>flower</div>
```

effect:
![](.Image/2023-01-11-16-06-40.)div>

### Custom Code Block

The code style is basically copy-pasted from [Google Protocol Buffers Doc](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), but I made some modifications.

effect:
![](.Image/2023-01-11-16-07-40.)div>

### Custom Block Quote

usage:
```markdown
>- Text...
```

Note that **NOT** `>` at the beginning, but `>-`. This is done to add a marker at the beginning (actually a list marker). This style is very common.

effect:
![](.Image/2023-01-11-16-14-10.png)

### Warning Block

Just a variant of Block Quote for warning content.

usage:
```markdown
<div class=warning><ul><li>

Warning! Warning!
</li></ul></div>
```

Note that there is an **empty line** here. If the content contains any special Markdown content (such as bold text: \*\*abc\*\*), then this line must be empty to display normally. On the other hand, if you are not using any special content, then this empty line is not necessary.

effect:
![](.Image/2023-01-11-16-17-38.png)

### Fold Block

The `details` tag from HTML.

usage:
```markdown
<details><summary>Title</summary>

Content
</details>
```

example:
```markdown
<details><summary>Copy this into init.vim</summary>

" Sample keybindings. Note these override default keybindings mentioned above.
nnoremap <C-w>> <Cmd>call <SID>manageEditorSize(v:count, 'increase')<CR>
xnoremap <C-w>> <Cmd>call <SID>manageEditorSize(v:count, 'increase')<CR>
nnoremap <C-w>+ <Cmd>call <SID>manageEditorSize(v:count, 'increase')<CR>
xnoremap <C-w>+ <Cmd>call <SID>manageEditorSize(v:count, 'increase')<CR>
nnoremap <C-w>< <Cmd>call <SID>manageEditorSize(v:count, 'decrease')<CR>
xnoremap <C-w>< <Cmd>call <SID>manageEditorSize(v:count, 'decrease')<CR>
nnoremap <C-w>- <Cmd>call <SID>manageEditorSize(v:count, 'decrease')<CR>
xnoremap <C-w>- <Cmd>call <SID>manageEditorSize(v:count, 'decrease')<CR>
</details>
```

effect:

### Suggestion
- Take more notes (including students and office workers)
- Use powerful screenshot software (such as: Snipaste)
- Paste images by plugin (such as: [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image&ssr=false#overview))
- Format table by plugin (such as: [Markdown Table Prettify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=darkriszty.markdown-table-prettify&ssr=false#overview))
